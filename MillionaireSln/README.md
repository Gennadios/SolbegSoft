# Who Wants to be a Millionaire Game Rules
Greetings, player, and welcome to Who Wants to be a Millionaire!
As contestant you have to select how many answers you'd like to answer at the title screen.

You can go with either 5, 10, or 15 questions:

To win the grand prize of **1,000,000**, you must answer all of the multiple-choice questions correctly in a row.
Unlike in original Who Wants to be a Millionaire TV show, there are no "guarantee points", which means that **if you make a mistake, you won't win anything at all**.
Also, there is only one hint available, and that is **50:50**. Be careful, you can only use it once during the game!

If you answer correctly to the question, you will have a chance to claim your prize money and stop playing.

If you choose to continue, however, there is no turning back: one mistake will cost you everything that you earned.
Do not worry, though, you'll have a chance for a rematch if you like. All you need to do is to click "Play again"
button. The game will restart and questions will be selected randomly once again.

Good luck!
